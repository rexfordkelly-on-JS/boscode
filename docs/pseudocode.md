It is expected that students are able to develop and interpret algorithms using pseudocode and flowcharts.

# Pseudocode

## Pseudocode guidelines
The pseudocode keywords are:

* for each procedure or subroutine
```
BEGIN name
END name
```
* for binary selection
```
IF condition THEN
  statements
ELSE
  statements
ENDIF
```
* for multi-way selection
```
CASEWHERE expression evaluates to
  A: process A
  B: process B
  ....
  OTHERWISE: process ...
ENDCASE
```
* for pre-test repetition
```
WHILE condition
  statements
ENDWHILE
```
* for post-test repetition
```
REPEAT
  statements
UNTIL condition
```
* for FOR/NEXT loops
```
FOR variable = start TO finish STEP increment
  statements
NEXT variable
```

In pseudocode:
* keywords are written in capitals
* structural elements come in pairs, eg for every BEGIN there is an END, for every IF there is an ENDIF.
* indenting is used to identify control structures in the algorithm
* the names of subprograms are underlined. This means that when refining the solution to a problem, a subroutine can be referred to in an algorithm by underlining its name, and a separate subprogram developed to show the logic of that routine. This feature enables the use of the top-down development concept, where details for a particular process need only be considered within the relevant subroutine.
